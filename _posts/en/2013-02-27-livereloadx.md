When we are developping a web site, we often edit source code and reload a browser. It would be wonderful if browsers are reloaded automatically.

There are some softwares such as [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) and [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/), but they are GUI tools and not free of charge. So I created a command line tool named [LiveReloadX](http://nitoyon.github.com/livereloadx/) based on [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) source code.

LiveReloadX is using Node.js, so it runs on Windows, Mac and Linux. It reloads the browser not only on developping environment but also on iPhone and Android. Of course, free of charge.

See [LiveReloadX](http://nitoyon.github.com/livereloadx/) for details!!

You can get source code from [nitoyon/livereloadx - GitHub](https://github.com/nitoyon/livereloadx). It would be a greate pleasure for me if you Star or send me a pull request.
